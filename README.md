# Vue Meetups

This repo contains the site for [VueMeetups](https://www.vuemeetups.org) in an effort to centralize all Vue.js community efforts (like meetups).

Please check out the the [Issues board](https://github.com/bencodezen/vue-meetups/issues) for discussions and tracking progress.

## Getting Setup

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Run `yarn` or `npm install`
3.  Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

## Deployment

The site currently uses [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to automatically detect changes on the `master` branch and deploys automatically.
